	  This is a picture of a Cessna 210. The 210 is the flagship
	  sing-engine Cessna aircraft. Although the 210 began as a 
	  four-place aircraft, it soon acquired a third row of seats,
	  stretching it to a six-place plane. The 210 is classified
	  as a high-performance airplane, which means its landing
	  gear is retractable and its engine has more than 200
	  horsepower. In its first model year, which was 1960,
	  the 210 was powered by a 260-horsepower fuel-injuected
	  six-cylinder engine that displaced 471 cubic inches.
	  The 210 is the fastest single-engine airplane ever
	  built by Cessna.
